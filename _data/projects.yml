    ## **How to Evaluate Your GNN Explanation: A User's Manual for Interpreting the explanations**
    
    ---
    Currently, several metrics have been proposed to evaluate the faithfulness of current state-of-the-art explanation methods
    in graph neural networks. However, there are several drawbacks among these evaluation metrics 
    that make their fair comparison challenging. Through this project, we mentioned these drawbacks 
    and instead proposed novel solutions with a guideline assisting in examining the focus of these 
    explainers better, and the target Graph Neural Networks. (**Submitted to CVPR 2023**)
