    ## **Malignancy classification and lesion segmenation in mammography screening using semi/weak supervised methods.**
    
    ---
    Breast cancer is considered the deadliest one among women. Our main goal is to provide 
    an AI assistant product to help radiologists with more accurate and swifter decision-making 
    through mammography screening and therefore increase the survival rate of our Iranian mothers 
    and ladies. As a member of the scientific team, I have contributed to a huge project 
    containing multiple sub-branches, including pre and post-image processing, malignancy classification, and lesion segmentation,
    using mostly weakly and semi-supervised methods due to insufficient annotated data.
