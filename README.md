I have developed two new features by implementing new workflows: 
 - *Edit last-time updated*:  your website can Automatically represent the last-time information has been updated. This helps the audience better know how long information on your website is up-to-date.
 - *Dynamic Dark Mode triggering*: By determining when to start light/dark mode in `_config.yml`, Dark mode is automatically triggered.
