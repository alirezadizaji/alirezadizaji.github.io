  **CV: [PDF](https://alirezadizaji.github.io/files/CV.pdf)**

  (Last updated: Dec. 2022) My name is Alireza Dizaji and I have recently been graduated as a Bachelor of Science student
  at the **Sharif University of Technology**, **Computer Engineering** field. 
  I have +3 years of research experience in the fields of computer vision and machine learning; 
  For the last seven months, I was a research intern at the **Technical University of Munich** 
  working on explainability in graph neural networks under the co-supervision of Prof. Navab and 
  Prof. Rueckert. For +1.5 years, I am working as an R&D scientist at AI-Med where our 
  focus is to solve and enhance current problems of medical imaging, particularly 
  mammography screening, under the supervision of Prof. Rabiee. I also have 1-year of experience 
  in the Reinforcement Learning field working on agent movement within a maze using 
  contrastive learning methods. My research interests are **Learning on Graphs** and **Graph Neural Networks**, 
  **Explainable Machine Learning**, and **Optimization**.

      Alongside my interests in science and technology, some of my other hobbies are:
        - Reading books (Fantasy genre mostly): I am a big fan of Fantasy books, and mostly
        spent my leisure time reading them. So far, I have read the <i> Hobbit </i>, <i> Lord of the Rings </i> (**My favorite one**),
        and <i> Harry Potter </i> series in English, both significantly (mostly the first two ones) 
        have changed my attitude towards faith, our being, and our path in our lives; 
        Indeed after reading them, I experienced how great books could marvelously direct your thought, 
        and I always ask for or suggest great books preferably in the fantasy genre.
        - Watching movies
        - Travelling and nature

          AI-Med is a multidisciplinary research consortium **utilizing artificial intelligence
          technologies to improve the quality and accuracy of digital health services**.
          since April 2021, I joined as **research and development scientist** here where
          we have designed a wide-range of deep-learning experiments (via Pytorch) to provide
          better **detection** and **localization** of abnormalities for **mammography screening**.
          our methods have reached and even gone beyond the state-of-the-art algorithms on **public dataset (DDSM)**.
          in order to maintain our results same for the **in-private dataset**, we are currently
          developing **weakly-supervised methods** to more precisely label and generate ground-truth ROIs for them.
          Moreover, we have designed several side tools to get real-time feedbacks from experienced radiologists for labeling.

          I joined [**DML lab**](http://dml.ce.sharif.edu/dmlsite/) as a **Research assistant** where I was working
          on the impact of **contrastive learning** approaches on **deep reinforcement-learning** algorithms.
          to be more specific, I implemented [**CURL**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04136.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com) 
          and [**SIMCLR**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709.pdf) (via Pytorch) algorithms to improve movement of an agent
          within Maze environment.
